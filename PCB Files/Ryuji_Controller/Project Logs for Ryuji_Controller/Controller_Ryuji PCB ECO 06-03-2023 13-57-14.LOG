Added Member To Class: ClassName=Headers_Controller Member=Component 1 Normally closed trace jumper    This jumper has a trace between two pads so it's normally closed (NC). Use a razor knife to open the connection. For best results follow the IPC guidelines for cutting traces: Cutout at least 0.063 mm (0.005 in).  Remove all loose material to clean up the cut area.  Seal the cut with an approved epoxy.       Reapply solder to reclose the connection.
